## Position

Position specifies where an object is located at a given instant, measured relative to a chosen reference frame — a coordinate system with an origin, a set of axes, and a unit of measurement. Because position is always relative, the number describing it depends entirely on the reference point you pick. A car might be "at mile marker 50" relative to a highway, or "3 meters from the wall" relative to a room. In one dimension, position is a single signed number, $x$, often measured in meters, where the sign indicates direction from the origin (positive to the right, negative to the left, by convention). In two or three dimensions, position requires more than one number to pin down — a pair $(x, y)$ or a triple $(x, y, z)$ — but the one-dimensional case captures the core idea and is what the rest of this section uses.

**Worked example.** Suppose a runner starts a race and a stopwatch begins at $t = 0$. Define the reference frame with the starting line as the origin and the positive direction pointing down the track. At $t = 2\text{ s}$, the runner is at $x = 10\text{ m}$; at $t = 4\text{ s}$, she is at $x = 22\text{ m}$. These two values are positions — snapshots of location at specific times. Note what position does *not* tell you directly: the total distance traveled (if she weaved sideways, distance could exceed the straight-line displacement) or her speed. Position is a description of "where," not "how far traveled" or "how fast."

**Problem-solving application.** Choosing the reference frame wisely is often the key move in solving a mechanics problem. Consider two blocks connected by a string over a pulley, one hanging and one on a table. Defining a consistent positive direction for each block (e.g., "down" as positive for the hanging block, matching the direction of its motion) lets the relationship linking their positions become a simple algebraic statement rather than a sign-error minefield: as one block's position increases, the other's decreases by the same amount, since the string length is fixed. When solving multi-object or multi-stage problems, always state your reference frame explicitly before writing equations: origin, positive direction, and units. This single habit eliminates a large fraction of errors in kinematics problems, since velocity and acceleration are both defined as rates of change of position, and an inconsistent frame propagates errors through every subsequent calculation.

## Time

Time is the interval over which change occurs. It is one of the seven SI base quantities, measured in seconds (s), and unlike length or mass, it cannot be directly compared side by side — you cannot lay two durations next to each other the way you lay two rulers next to each other. Instead, time is measured indirectly, by counting repetitions of a process assumed to repeat identically: a pendulum swing, a heartbeat, a vibration. Since 1967, the SI second has been defined by counting exactly 9,192,631,770 oscillations of radiation emitted by a cesium-133 atom transitioning between two hyperfine energy states. This atomic standard replaced earlier definitions based on Earth's rotation, which turned out to vary slightly and unpredictably.

**Worked example.** Suppose a cesium clock reports that a signal has completed $4{,}596{,}315{,}885$ oscillations. How many seconds have elapsed? Since one second corresponds to $9{,}192{,}631{,}770$ oscillations,
$$
t = \frac{4{,}596{,}315{,}885}{9{,}192{,}631{,}770} \text{ s} \approx 0.5000\text{ s}.
$$
This illustrates the core idea: a time measurement is always a ratio — the number of elapsed cycles divided by the defined cycle rate of the reference standard.

**Problem-solving application.** Timekeeping systems must be calibrated against this standard, and calibration errors compound. GPS satellites, for instance, carry onboard atomic clocks, and receivers on Earth compute position by timing how long radio signals take to arrive from multiple satellites: distance equals the signal's travel time multiplied by the speed of light. Because the speed of light is so large, a clock error of just one microsecond ($10^{-6}$ s) translates into a position error of about 300 meters. This is why GPS satellite clocks are corrected not only for such drift but also for relativistic time dilation caused by their speed and altitude — without correction, GPS positioning would degrade by several kilometers per day.

When solving problems involving time, always check the units and the reference frame first: is the duration given in seconds, and is it measured against the same standard as any rate or speed used alongside it? Mismatched time bases — for example, mixing a locally measured clock with an uncorrected satellite clock — are a common source of error in real-world systems that depend on precise timing, from financial trading networks to power-grid synchronization.

## Vector

A vector is a quantity defined by both magnitude (size) and direction, in contrast to a scalar, which has magnitude alone. Temperature, mass, and speed are scalars — a single number fully describes them. But velocity, force, and displacement are vectors: saying a car travels "60 km/h" is incomplete without specifying which way it's heading. Graphically, a vector is drawn as an arrow: the length represents magnitude, and the arrowhead indicates direction. In two dimensions, a vector can be written in component form as $\vec{v} = \langle v_x, v_y \rangle$, where $v_x$ and $v_y$ are the horizontal and vertical projections. Its magnitude is found using the Pythagorean theorem: $|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$.

**Worked example.** Suppose a hiker walks 3 km east, then 4 km north. The resultant displacement vector is $\vec{d} = \langle 3, 4 \rangle$. Its magnitude is $|\vec{d}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5$ km. Notice that the hiker's total distance walked (7 km) differs from the magnitude of displacement (5 km) — distance is a scalar accumulating path length, while displacement is a vector capturing net change in position. This distinction is the core reason vectors matter: they preserve information that scalars discard.

**Problem-solving application.** Vectors combine by adding their components separately: $\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \langle a_x + b_x, a_y + b_y \rangle$. This rule underlies many real-world problems. Consider an airplane flying with a velocity of $\langle 200, 0 \rangle$ km/h (due east) through a wind blowing at $\langle 0, -30 \rangle$ km/h (due south). The plane's actual velocity relative to the ground is the vector sum: $\langle 200, -30 \rangle$, giving a ground speed of $\sqrt{200^2 + 30^2} \approx 202.2$ km/h, angled slightly south of the intended course. To correct for wind drift and fly a true easterly path, a pilot must add a compensating vector to cancel the southward component — a calculation routinely used in aviation and navigation. This same additive structure applies to combining forces in physics, summing displacements in robotics path planning, or aggregating feature contributions in data science, making vector addition one of the most widely reused problem-solving tools in quantitative fields.

## Displacement

Displacement describes how much an object's position has changed, and in which direction. If an object starts at position $x_i$ and ends at position $x_f$, its displacement is

$$\Delta x = x_f - x_i.$$

This is a vector: it has both a magnitude (how far) and a direction (which way). That distinction sets displacement apart from distance, which only tracks the total length of the path traveled and ignores direction entirely. A runner who completes one full lap of a 400 m track has traveled a distance of 400 m, but their displacement is zero — they end up exactly where they started.

**Worked example.** Suppose a car starts at position $x_i = 2\text{ m}$ on a straight road (measured from some reference point) and drives to $x_f = -5\text{ m}$. Its displacement is

$$\Delta x = x_f - x_i = -5\text{ m} - 2\text{ m} = -7\text{ m}.$$

The negative sign doesn't mean "negative distance" — it tells us the car moved 7 m in the negative direction along the chosen axis (say, westward if positive was defined as east). The magnitude of the displacement is 7 m; the direction is west.

**Problem-solving application.** Displacement becomes especially useful when motion involves multiple stages, because displacements along the same axis add algebraically, while distances always add as positive numbers. Consider a drone that flies 30 m north, then 50 m south. The total distance flown is $30 + 50 = 80$ m. But taking north as positive, the net displacement is

$$\Delta x = (+30\text{ m}) + (-50\text{ m}) = -20\text{ m},$$

meaning the drone ends up 20 m south of its starting point. This additive property is what makes displacement the right quantity for tracking net position change in multi-leg trips, and it's also why average velocity is defined using displacement ($\bar{v} = \Delta x / \Delta t$) rather than distance — velocity cares about where you ended up relative to where you started, not how much ground you covered getting there. When solving problems involving round trips, back-and-forth motion, or vector addition in two dimensions, always identify a consistent positive direction first, then combine displacements as signed (or vector) quantities rather than summing raw magnitudes.

## Elapsed Time

Elapsed time is the interval between the start and end of a motion, defined as $\Delta t = t_f - t_0$, where $t_0$ is the beginning time and $t_f$ is the ending time. It is always measured in seconds (or a converted unit like minutes or hours) and, for physical motion, is always positive — an object cannot finish moving before it starts. Elapsed time is the denominator in nearly every rate calculation you will encounter in kinematics: average velocity, average acceleration, and average speed are all defined as some change divided by $\Delta t$.

**Worked example.** A cyclist passes a marker at $t_0 = 2.5\ \text{s}$ on a stopwatch and passes a second marker at $t_f = 9.1\ \text{s}$. The elapsed time is
$$\Delta t = t_f - t_0 = 9.1\ \text{s} - 2.5\ \text{s} = 6.6\ \text{s}.$$
If the markers are $52.8\ \text{m}$ apart, the cyclist's average velocity over that interval is $v_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{52.8\ \text{m}}{6.6\ \text{s}} = 8.0\ \text{m/s}$.

**Problem-solving application.** Elapsed time calculations become error-prone in two common situations, both worth watching for:

1. *Non-zero starting time.* Motion problems rarely begin their clock at $t_0 = 0$. If a ball is launched at $t_0 = 3.2\ \text{s}$ and lands at $t_f = 5.7\ \text{s}$, the time of flight is $\Delta t = 2.5\ \text{s}$ — not $5.7\ \text{s}$. Always subtract the given $t_0$ rather than assuming it is zero.

2. *Clock-time versus interval.* Times given as clock readings (e.g., "2:15 p.m." to "2:48 p.m.") must first be converted to a common time base — here, minutes elapsed since a reference point — before subtracting. Working in clock format directly (48 − 15 = 33, ignoring the hour) only works when both times share the same hour; crossing an hour or day boundary requires converting everything to a single unit (seconds or minutes) first.

In multi-stage motion problems — where an object accelerates, then travels at constant velocity, then decelerates — track $\Delta t$ separately for each stage. The total elapsed time is the sum of the stage intervals, but average velocity for the whole trip is *not* the average of the stage velocities; it is total displacement divided by total elapsed time.

---

## Average Velocity

Average velocity describes how an object's position changes, on average, over a stretch of time. It is defined as the displacement — the change in position — divided by the elapsed time:

$$\bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}$$

Because displacement is a vector (it has direction, not just size), average velocity is also a vector, with SI unit meters per second (m/s). Note that displacement is not the same as the total distance traveled along the path. A runner who completes one full lap of a 400 m track ends up back at the starting line: the distance covered is 400 m, but the displacement — the straight-line change in position — is 0 m, so the average velocity for that lap is 0 m/s.

**Worked example.** A cyclist starts at position $x_1 = 20\text{ m}$ at time $t_1 = 2\text{ s}$ and is later found at $x_2 = -30\text{ m}$ at $t_2 = 12\text{ s}$ (negative meaning "west of the origin," say). The displacement is:

$$\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = -30 - 20 = -50\text{ m}$$

The elapsed time is $\Delta t = 12 - 2 = 10\text{ s}$. So:

$$\bar{v} = \frac{-50\text{ m}}{10\text{ s}} = -5\text{ m/s}$$

The negative sign is not an error — it tells you the cyclist's net motion was in the negative direction, at a magnitude of 5 m/s.

**Problem-solving application.** Average velocity is most useful when you only have "before and after" data, not a full description of the motion in between. Suppose a drone takes off from a rooftop at 15 m height, flies a complicated path, and lands on the ground (0 m) 8 seconds later. Even without knowing the flight path, you can immediately compute:

$$\bar{v} = \frac{0 - 15\text{ m}}{8\text{ s}} = -1.875\text{ m/s}$$

This tells you the *net* rate of descent, useful for estimating total energy loss or comparing trips, but it says nothing about the drone's rate of motion at any instant — it might have hovered, dived, and climbed along the way. Recognizing this gap between average and instantaneous behavior is the conceptual bridge toward the derivative-based definition of instantaneous velocity introduced next.

---

## Average Acceleration

Average acceleration measures how fast velocity changes over a time interval. It is defined as

$$\bar{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t_f - t_i}$$

where $v_i$ and $v_f$ are the initial and final velocities and $t_i$, $t_f$ mark the interval's endpoints. Because velocity is a vector, so is average acceleration: it has both magnitude and direction, and its SI unit is meters per second squared ($\text{m/s}^2$). A positive acceleration doesn't always mean "speeding up" — it means the velocity is changing in the positive direction, which could mean speeding up while moving forward or slowing down while moving backward.

**Worked example.** A car traveling east at $v_i = 12\ \text{m/s}$ speeds up to $v_f = 28\ \text{m/s}$ over a time interval of $\Delta t = 8\ \text{s}$. Its average acceleration is

$$\bar{a} = \frac{28\ \text{m/s} - 12\ \text{m/s}}{8\ \text{s}} = \frac{16\ \text{m/s}}{8\ \text{s}} = 2\ \text{m/s}^2 \text{ (east)}$$

This means that, on average, the car's eastward velocity increased by 2 m/s during every second of the 8-second interval — though the *instantaneous* acceleration at any given moment could have been higher or lower, since $\bar{a}$ only reports the net change smoothed over the whole interval.

**Problem-solving application.** Average acceleration is most useful when you're given velocity data at two points in time and asked to characterize the motion between them, without needing (or having) a detailed record of what happened in between. Suppose a cyclist decelerates from $18\ \text{m/s}$ to a stop in $4.5\ \text{s}$ while braking. Rearranging the definition,

$$\Delta v = \bar{a}\,\Delta t \implies \bar{a} = \frac{0 - 18\ \text{m/s}}{4.5\ \text{s}} = -4\ \text{m/s}^2$$

The negative sign indicates the acceleration points opposite to the direction of motion — consistent with braking. This same rearranged relationship, $\Delta v = \bar{a}\,\Delta t$, lets you solve for an unknown final velocity, initial velocity, or elapsed time whenever the other two quantities and the average acceleration are known, making it a core algebraic tool for one-dimensional kinematics problems.

## Kinematic Equations Constant Acceleration

When acceleration is constant, the motion of an object — its position, velocity, and time — is fully described by four algebraic relationships. Each equation connects a different subset of five variables: initial position $x_0$, final position $x$, initial velocity $v_0$, final velocity $v$, acceleration $a$, and time $t$:

$$v = v_0 + at$$
$$x = x_0 + \bar{v}t, \quad \text{where } \bar{v} = \frac{v_0+v}{2}$$
$$x = x_0 + v_0t + \tfrac{1}{2}at^2$$
$$v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a\Delta x$$

These are not four independent laws of physics — they are algebraic consequences of two definitions (average velocity and constant acceleration) combined and rearranged. The reason there are four is practical: each equation omits one variable, so you can pick the one equation that doesn't require a quantity you don't know.

**Worked example.** A car accelerates from rest ($v_0 = 0$) at $a = 3\ \text{m/s}^2$ for $t = 4\ \text{s}$. Find its displacement.

Here the unknown we don't care about is final velocity $v$, so use the equation without $v$:
$$x - x_0 = v_0t + \tfrac{1}{2}at^2 = 0 + \tfrac{1}{2}(3)(4)^2 = 24\ \text{m}$$

Check with a second equation: $v = v_0 + at = 0 + 12 = 12\ \text{m/s}$, and $\bar{v}t = \frac{0+12}{2}(4) = 24\ \text{m}$. Consistent.

**Problem-solving strategy.** The four equations form a small toolkit, and the skill being tested is *selection*, not memorization. List the five variables, mark which three are given and which one is asked for, and pick the equation that excludes the fifth (unknown-and-unwanted) variable. This avoids solving a quadratic or a two-step chain when a single direct equation exists.

For example, a braking-distance problem ("car slows from 20 m/s to 0 over $\Delta x = 40\ \text{m}$; find $a$") gives $v_0, v, \Delta x$ and asks for $a$ — no $t$ appears, so $v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a\Delta x$ is the direct route: $a = \frac{0 - 400}{80} = -5\ \text{m/s}^2$. Recognizing which variable is absent from the question is the actual problem-solving skill these equations train.

## Problem Solving Kinematics

One-dimensional kinematics involves only five variables—position (or displacement, $\Delta x$), initial velocity ($v_0$), final velocity ($v$), acceleration ($a$), and time ($t$)—linked by a small set of equations. The challenge students face is rarely the physics itself; it is deciding which equation to use and keeping track of what is actually known. A systematic six-step method removes that guesswork.

**Step 1 — Identify the governing principle.** Confirm the motion is one-dimensional with constant acceleration, which justifies using the standard kinematic equations rather than calculus-based variable-acceleration methods.

**Step 2 — List the knowns.** Extract every numerical value given, assigning consistent signs based on a chosen positive direction.

**Step 3 — Identify the unknown.** State exactly what the problem asks for.

**Step 4 — Select the equation** that contains the unknown and only known quantities—avoiding unnecessary multi-step chains.

**Step 5 — Substitute values with units** and solve algebraically before plugging in numbers, then compute.

**Step 6 — Verify reasonableness**, checking units, sign, and order of magnitude.

**Worked example.** A car accelerates from rest at $2.5\ \text{m/s}^2$ for $6\ \text{s}$. Find the distance traveled.

- *Knowns*: $v_0 = 0$, $a = 2.5\ \text{m/s}^2$, $t = 6\ \text{s}$
- *Unknown*: $\Delta x$
- *Equation*: $\Delta x = v_0 t + \tfrac{1}{2}at^2$
- *Substitute*: $\Delta x = 0 + \tfrac{1}{2}(2.5)(6)^2 = 45\ \text{m}$
- *Check*: 45 m in 6 s from rest under modest acceleration is physically sensible—neither absurdly small nor unreasonably large.

**Problem-solving application.** The real payoff of this method appears in multi-part or multi-object problems, such as two cars starting at different times or a ball thrown upward that later falls back down. By re-running the six steps for each phase of motion—resetting knowns and unknowns at each transition (e.g., velocity at the top of a throw is zero, but time continues accumulating)—students avoid the most common error: reusing a variable's value from one phase in the equation for another. Treating each stage as a fresh six-step problem, connected only by shared boundary conditions (final velocity of phase one becomes initial velocity of phase two), turns seemingly complex kinematics problems into a sequence of manageable, verifiable calculations.

## Payoff

Problem-solving kinematics is the capstone because it converts a collection of separate rules — constant velocity, constant acceleration, projectile motion, relative motion — into a single reasoning strategy: identify what is changing, choose the equation that connects the known quantities to the unknown, and check the answer against physical intuition. Earlier sections taught you the vocabulary of motion (position, velocity, acceleration) and the individual equations that describe idealized cases. This final concept is not a new equation at all; it is the disciplined habit of translating a messy, real-world description into the symbols those equations require, then translating the numerical answer back into a sentence about the physical world. That translation skill — not any single formula — is what makes kinematics useful once you leave the textbook.

Consider a ball thrown from a rooftop at an angle. No single equation "solves" this by itself. You must recognize that horizontal and vertical motion are independent, that $v_x = v_0\cos\theta$ stays constant while $v_y = v_0\sin\theta - gt$ evolves under gravity, and that the moment the ball lands is defined by a boundary condition (height returns to zero, or to the ground level below the roof) rather than by the equations alone. Setting up that boundary condition — not manipulating algebra — is the hard part, and it is exactly the skill problem-solving kinematics trains.

This is why kinematics sits at the root of so much applied science and engineering. In vehicle safety design, the same reasoning finds stopping distances and crash-impact times from speed and deceleration limits. In sports biomechanics, it recovers a sprinter's acceleration curve or a basketball's optimal launch angle from video-tracked position data. In robotics and animation, it drives trajectory planning, ensuring a robotic arm or animated character moves through space smoothly and arrives exactly on time. In astronomy and spaceflight, the same independence of directional motion lets engineers compute orbital insertion windows and landing trajectories. In each case, the physics is unchanged; what differs is the boundary conditions and the units of the problem, and mastering that translation is what separates memorized formulas from real problem-solving ability.

From here, pick the domain that pulls at your curiosity most and follow it: work through a vehicle-safety braking scenario, model a projectile in sports, or trace a spacecraft's descent trajectory. Each is the same skill, wearing a different costume.
