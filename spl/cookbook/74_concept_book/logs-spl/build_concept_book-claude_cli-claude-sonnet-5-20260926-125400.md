## Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics is the theory describing matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales, where classical physics fails to predict experimental results. Its central object is the **wave function** $\psi(x,t)$, a complex-valued function whose squared magnitude $|\psi(x,t)|^2$ gives the *probability density* of finding a particle at position $x$ at time $t$. Unlike classical mechanics, where a particle has a definite position and velocity at every instant, quantum mechanics replaces certainty with probability: outcomes of measurements are inherently statistical, governed by the wave function's evolution under the **Schrödinger equation**:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2 \psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x)\psi(x,t)
$$

Here $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $m$ the particle's mass, and $V(x)$ the potential energy function. This equation plays the role that Newton's second law plays in classical mechanics — it tells you how the system evolves in time, but the object evolving is a probability amplitude, not a trajectory.

**Worked example.** Consider a particle confined to an infinite square well of width $L$ (the "particle in a box"). Solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation with boundary conditions $\psi(0) = \psi(L) = 0$ yields quantized energy levels:

$$
E_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \dots
$$

Unlike a classical particle bouncing in a box, which can have any energy, the quantum particle can only occupy discrete energy states. This quantization — not an assumption, but a direct consequence of requiring $\psi$ to be single-valued and vanish at the boundaries — is the hallmark of quantum behavior and explains phenomena like atomic emission spectra.

**Problem-solving application.** Given an electron in a box of width $L = 0.1\,\text{nm}$ (roughly atomic scale), you can compute the energy gap between the ground state ($n=1$) and first excited state ($n=2$) by plugging into the formula above: $\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = \frac{3\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. This lets you predict the wavelength of light absorbed or emitted when the electron transitions between levels, via $E = hc/\lambda$ — a direct bridge between the abstract quantum formalism and a measurable spectroscopic prediction.
