    # up with a path that's only valid when the current process happens to

    # uses spl_dir as the child's cwd and passes public_domains-derived
    # paths as a --param string to a spl3 subprocess running in yet another
    # cwd, so both silently break as soon as either differs — surfacing as
    # an uninformative uvloop "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or
    # directory" (spl_dir) or a ToolFailed deep inside spl3 pointing at a
    # path resolved relative to the wrong directory entirely
    # (public_domains, resolved by graph_lib.load_domain as a last resort
    # relative to its own file's directory).
